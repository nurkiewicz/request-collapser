# Use cases
* collapse multiple, independent requests, into a single batch one
* batch GET requests, database inserts, message publishing
* fire-and-forget operations that are not time-sensitive
* batching user-activity on frontend to send single HTTP POST instead of multiple small ones (aka. throttling, debouncing)
* incrementing a counter in batches, rather than multiple `+1`
* fetching batch of database sequence values

# Features
* Supports array and map input
* Advanced testing capabilities with fake timers
* Optional deduplication
* Run immediately if necessary
* Built-in metrics (collapsed request size, queueing time)
* Custom queue implementation

# When not to use
* Caching works good
* You need fast response time and can't tolerate lag
* When your operations need to run sequentially (`await` after `await`)
* When your operation is part of transaction
* When operation must be part of larger trace/span

# Modes of operation
* Time-based
* Size-based
* Time-based with size cap (default)

# Configuration options
* Window length, default 100ms
* Window size, default 32

# API
* `flush()` - to force batch operation run
* `skipQueue` - to run operation immediately, without queuing
* `enableDeduplication` - same requests are run only once. May include additional comparison method
* `getQueueLength()`
